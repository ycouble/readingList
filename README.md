# readingList

A list of articles I've read. View it here: TODO. Automatically updated by a button I press on another service somewhere else.

# Duplicate this for yourself
- fork repo
- create a token with the repo authorizations
- customize `bookmarklet` with your url, token and rating (one for each of your bookmarklet)
- customize `.site/save.html` to match your setup
