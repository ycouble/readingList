https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/,The Illustrated Stable Diffusion ‚Äì Jay Alammar ‚Äì Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.,"AI image generation is the most recent AI capability blowing people‚Äôs minds (mine included). The ability to create striking visuals from text descriptions has a magical quality to it and points clearly to a shift in how humans create art. The release of Stable Diffusion is a clear milestone in this development because it made a high-performance model available to the masses (performance in terms of image quality, as well as speed and relatively low resource/memory requirements).  After experimenting with AI image generation, you may start to wonder how it works.  This is a gentle introduction to how Stable Diffusion works.            Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a number of different ways. Let‚Äôs focus at first on image generation from text only (text2img). The image above shows an example text input and the resulting generated image (The actual complete prompt is here). Aside from text to image, another main way of using it is by making it alter images (so inputs are text + image).  ",,2022-10-05T11:55:55.189518547Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33084205,5

https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03945,[2210.03945] Understanding HTML with Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on a variety of natural language tasks. Yet, their capabilities for HTML understanding -- i.e., parsing the raw HTML of a webpage, with applications to automation of web-based tasks, crawling, and browser-assisted retrieval -- have not been fully explored. We contribute HTML understanding models (fine-tuned LLMs) and an in-depth analysis of their capabilities under three tasks: (i) Semantic Classification of HTML elements, (ii) Description Generation for HTML inputs, and (iii) Autonomous Web Navigation of HTML pages. While previous work has developed dedicated architectures and training procedures for HTML understanding, we show that LLMs pretrained on standard natural language corpora transfer remarkably well to HTML understanding tasks. For instance, fine-tuned LLMs are 12% more accurate at semantic classification compared to models trained exclusively on the task dataset. Moreover, when fine-tuned on data from the MiniWoB benchmark, LLMs successfully complete 50% more tasks using 192x less data compared to the previous best supervised model. Out of the LLMs we evaluate, we show evidence that T5-based models are ideal due to their bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture. To promote further research on LLMs for HTML understanding, we create and open-source a large-scale HTML dataset distilled and auto-labeled from CommonCrawl.",,2022-10-12T08:27:19.775898411Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33168043,4

https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250,[2301.00250] DensePose From WiFi,"Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques have led to significant development in 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB cameras, LiDAR, and radars. However, human pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest. Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive. Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing.",,2023-01-23T14:15:41.354474373Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34423395,4

https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06762?ref=txt.cohere.com,[2304.06762] Shall We Pretrain Autoregressive Language Models with Retrieval? A Comprehensive Study,"Large decoder-only language models (LMs) can be largely improved in terms of perplexity by retrieval (e.g., RETRO), but its impact on text generation quality and downstream task accuracy is unclear. Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT across different model sizes. Our findings highlight the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models. We release our implementation at: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM#retro",https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png,2023-05-22T08:08:51.227879595Z,,5

https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13250?ref=txt.cohere.com,[2304.13250] Exploring the Curious Case of Code Prompts,"Recent work has shown that prompting language models with code-like representations of natural language leads to performance improvements on structured reasoning tasks. However, such tasks comprise only a small subset of all natural language tasks. In our work, we seek to answer whether or not code-prompting is the preferred way of interacting with language models in general. We compare code and text prompts across three popular GPT models (davinci, code-davinci-002, and text-davinci-002) on a broader selection of tasks (e.g., QA, sentiment, summarization) and find that with few exceptions, code prompts do not consistently outperform text prompts. Furthermore, we show that the style of code prompt has a large effect on performance for some but not all tasks and that fine-tuning on text instructions leads to better relative performance of code prompts.",https://static.arxiv.org/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-fb.png,2023-05-22T08:11:46.027743282Z,,4

Certains d√©partements nous ont demand√© de contacter directement les communaut√©s de communes pour obtenir l‚Äôinformation.Convertir les fichiers pour harmoniser leur format (nous avons re√ßu des fichiers Excel, Shapefile, geoJSON, word, carte en jpeg, PDF de scans‚Ä¶)Convertir les donn√©es g√©ographiques en WGS84Compl√©ter le nom, l‚Äôadresse, la latitude et la longitude en cherchant les informations sur Google Maps2 types de covoiturage, 2 types de lieux :Aires de covoiturage domicile-travail :Les aires de covoiturage avec panneau officiel sont souvent en zones rurales, au croisement de deux d√©partementales en dehors des villes/villages. Elles permettent √† certains conducteurs de laisser leur voiture pour la journ√©e afin de partager le trajet en tant que passager. Ces Aires sont donc destin√©es √† √™tre pleines en journ√©e. En plus des aires, les supermarch√©s et parking des h√¥tels (plut√¥t occup√©s la nuit) peuvent √™tre de bons emplacements pour ce cas d‚ÄôusageParkings de covoiturage longue distance :Lorsqu‚Äôun conducteur prend ou d√©pose ses passagers pour partir en weekend ou en vacances, il s‚Äôagit plut√¥t d‚Äôune occupation temporaire du parking de 15 minutes environ (donc sans stationnement longue dur√©e). Pour autant cette pratique requiert des parkings l√©gaux, s√©curis√©s et bien identifi√©s pour √©viter que ces RDV s‚Äôorganisent de mani√®re anarchique en zone urbaine ou en bord d‚Äôautoroute. L‚Äôemplacement id√©al de ces parkings est en bordure de zone urbaine et √† une connexion de transport en commun pour les passagers. Les Parc Relais en terminus de ligne de transport en commun sont donc par exemple de tr√®s bons choix.Recommandations de BlaBlaCar pour futures Aires &amp; parking de covoiturage :  Stop √† l'artificialisation des sols :Nul besoin de construire de nouvelles Aires et parking, il suffit parfois de r√©f√©rencer les parkings existants : Places, √âglises, Stades, Restaurants, H√¥tels, Supermarch√©s‚Ä¶ Ils ont l‚Äôavantage d‚Äô√™tre facilement identifiables et d‚Äô√™tre plus centraux pour les passagers.Sp√©cificit√© des Sorties d‚Äôautoroute et route nationale :Gr√¢ce √† son nouvel algorithme de calcul d‚Äô√©tapes le long de chaque trajet, BlaBlaCar peut transformer chaque route en ‚ÄúLigne de voitures en commun‚Äù : un conducteur qui fait Paris Valence peut prendre un passager √† Beaune et le poser √† Lyon √† condition qu‚Äôil puissent le prendre et le d√©poser aux entr√©es/sortie d‚Äôautoroute.Or la majorit√© des petits parkings aux gares de P√©age comme celui-ci (P√©age d‚ÄôArsy) ne se pr√™te pas aux arr√™ts de covoiturage car le conducteur ne peut pas faire demi tour pour reprendre l‚Äôautoroute (au del√† de l‚Äôinterdiction et de la prise de risque, il y a parfois des s√©parations physiques). Certains au contraire comme celui-ci (Parking de covoiturage de Manosque) ou celui-l√† (P√©age de Troyes-Centre, Sainte-Savine) sont appr√©ci√©s car permettent de faire demi tour pour pouvoir d√©poser ou prendre un passager et reprendre la route. Minimiser le temps de d√©tour est LA condition sine qua non au partage massif des trajets en voiture √† l‚Äôavenir. Les passagers qui se retrouvent sur un parking de sortie d‚Äôautoroute ont l‚Äôoption d‚Äôappeler leur famille ou de prendre un bus r√©gional. Id√©alement, les bus r√©gionaux/d√©partementaux pourraient pr√©voir des arr√™ts √† chaque Sorties d'autoroute pour prendre le relais du covoiturage (principalement le vendredi soir et dimanche soir).N√©cessit√© de nommer les lieuxDe nombreux d√©partements ont envoy√© des lieux s‚Äôappelant ‚ÄúParking‚Äù ou ‚ÄúAire‚Äù avec pour seule adresse le nom de la ville. Cela engendrera in√©vitablement des confusions et nous avons essay√©, en les cherchant sur Google Map de les nommer du mieux que l‚Äôon a pu.Les Aires se trouvant souvent proches de rond-points, une solution pourrait √™tre de nommer chaque rond-point tel que les locaux les d√©criraient.Un format communCompte tenu de l'h√©t√©rog√©n√©it√© de la documentation actuelles, nous proposons que le format de ce fichier devienne la r√©f√©rence pour le suivi des Aires de covoiturage partout en France.Comment enrichir et compl√©ter ce fichier ?Vous avez un point √† ajouter ?Utilisez ce formulaire en ligne pour renseigner votre suggestionVous avez plusieurs points √† ajouter ?Envoyer votre fichier via ce formulaire de t√©l√©chargement en respectant bien ce format de r√©f√©rence.",https://data.opendatasoft.com/static/ods/imgv4/social-images/social_media_image_table.png,2023-05-30T14:28:13.302800617Z,,2
