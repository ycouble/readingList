Many fields apart from machine learning are also finding differentiable programming to be a useful tool for solving many kinds of optimization problems. In computer graphics, differentiable rendering, differentiable physics, and neural representations are all poised to be important tools going forward.",,2022-10-02T19:27:11.067951779Z,,4

https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/,The Illustrated Stable Diffusion ‚Äì Jay Alammar ‚Äì Visualizing machine learning one concept at a time.,"AI image generation is the most recent AI capability blowing people‚Äôs minds (mine included). The ability to create striking visuals from text descriptions has a magical quality to it and points clearly to a shift in how humans create art. The release of Stable Diffusion is a clear milestone in this development because it made a high-performance model available to the masses (performance in terms of image quality, as well as speed and relatively low resource/memory requirements).  After experimenting with AI image generation, you may start to wonder how it works.  This is a gentle introduction to how Stable Diffusion works.            Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a number of different ways. Let‚Äôs focus at first on image generation from text only (text2img). The image above shows an example text input and the resulting generated image (The actual complete prompt is here). Aside from text to image, another main way of using it is by making it alter images (so inputs are text + image).  ",,2022-10-05T11:55:55.189518547Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33084205,5

https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03945,[2210.03945] Understanding HTML with Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on a variety of natural language tasks. Yet, their capabilities for HTML understanding -- i.e., parsing the raw HTML of a webpage, with applications to automation of web-based tasks, crawling, and browser-assisted retrieval -- have not been fully explored. We contribute HTML understanding models (fine-tuned LLMs) and an in-depth analysis of their capabilities under three tasks: (i) Semantic Classification of HTML elements, (ii) Description Generation for HTML inputs, and (iii) Autonomous Web Navigation of HTML pages. While previous work has developed dedicated architectures and training procedures for HTML understanding, we show that LLMs pretrained on standard natural language corpora transfer remarkably well to HTML understanding tasks. For instance, fine-tuned LLMs are 12% more accurate at semantic classification compared to models trained exclusively on the task dataset. Moreover, when fine-tuned on data from the MiniWoB benchmark, LLMs successfully complete 50% more tasks using 192x less data compared to the previous best supervised model. Out of the LLMs we evaluate, we show evidence that T5-based models are ideal due to their bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture. To promote further research on LLMs for HTML understanding, we create and open-source a large-scale HTML dataset distilled and auto-labeled from CommonCrawl.",,2022-10-12T08:27:19.775898411Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33168043,4

https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250,[2301.00250] DensePose From WiFi,"Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques have led to significant development in 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB cameras, LiDAR, and radars. However, human pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest. Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive. Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing.",,2023-01-23T14:15:41.354474373Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34423395,4
